================================
In 1860, the expansion of the city of Barcelona was defined as a grid structure know as The Cerdà Plan. 

Cerdà designed two large perpendicular avenues that were 45º with the grid of the Eixample: the Parallel (East-West) and Meridiana (North-South).

The Parallel Avenue continues the terrestrial parallel 41º 22' 29.71"N and Avenida Meridiana is aligned according to the meridian 2º 11' 12.89"E

The Parallel and Meridiana were cut perpendicular in the Old Lighthouse of the Port of Barcelona, now transformed into a clock (La torre del Rellotge, sXVIII)

Bisector of the Parallel and Meridiana almost fit the 'Decumanus Maximus' road of the ancient roman city.
